                        <p class="about__text"> The Capstone Project is the synthesis of my undergraduate degree, in which I have teamed up with three fellow Mechanical Engineers to put our college experience into a real solution. Our team’s name is JAMS, an acronym of all of our names. We are designing a glove mechanism for an aeronautical glovebox to gain experience in the aerospace industry.</p>

                            </div>
                        <p class="about__text"> The problem we are solving is the lack of a concrete fastening device for the Life Sciences Glovebox (LSG) on the ISS. Since the LSG’s specifications are proprietary information, we are constructing our own constraints and specifications to develop a device that can maintain a vacuum seal, provide tension to gloves, and quickly release in case of an emergency.</p>

                          </div>
                        <p class="about__text"> My team and I have communicated a timeline and budget for the project, developing a Gantt Chart, and we have created numerous technical reports to explicate our progress and propose our solution. JAMS plan on completing the project before graduation, with a fully functional and validated product.</p> 
                            <br>
                        <p class="about__text"> This project is a test of the culmination of all my engineering experience and an in-depth opportunity to execute the engineering design process. I have designed a website to catalogue updates and document the progress of the project. The website has commenting capabilities to allow users to provide feedback and field questions. I also designed a user-friendly interface and brand for JAMS to market our collaborative efforts and display our friendly attitude toward building a working solution.</p>
